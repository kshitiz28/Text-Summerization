              "('By . Harriet Arkell For Mailonline . A pair of friends who dreamt up Marmite-themed board games during drunken dinners together have told how they won £50,000 backing from the Dragons\\' Den investment show. Father of two Richard McLuckie, 48, and his friend Stuart Mackenzie-Walker, 51, dreamt up a series of board games including Love It Or Hate It and Who Put The Marmite In The Fridge, over long evenings spent playing games and drinking wine. They won permission to use the name Marmite from brand owner, Unilever, before going onto Dragons\\' Den to ask for funding. But the pair, who have been friends since childhood when they lived across a glen from each other in Argyll, nearly lost their chance when they weren\\'t allowed to mention the name Marmite to the inquisitive Dragons. Scroll down for video . The friends came up with the idea of Marmite-themed board games - and persuaded the Dragons to invest . Dragons Duncan Bannatyne, second left, and Peter Jones, second right, put up £50,000 for the board games . Mr McLuckie, a former property developer who lives near Avignon, France, with his French wife, Betty, 43, and their daughters Clara, 15, and Esmee, 13, said: \\'Unilever had agreed to the licensing contract but told us we couldn\\'t mention Marmite on the show as they hadn\\'t yet agreed the design of the game. \\'They didn\\'t want any mention of it til it was signed off, so we were worried the Dragons wouldn\\'t be interested.\\' Three Dragons took their money off the table early, leaving Duncan Bannatyne and Peter Jones demanding to know more. Mr McLuckie said: \\'We told them we couldn\\'t say the name but it was an iconic brand and a well-known supermarket brand. \\'Eventually they demanded to see paperwork and when we showed it to them, Peter Jones said \"Oh it\\'s Marmite\", and they agreed to invest. Jones and Bannatyne said they would buy a 40 per cent stake in the men\\'s games start-up, Pants On Fire, and the games will go on sale next month. Love It Or Hate It, the title of which is based on the idea that Marmite provokes strong reactions one way or the other, is a game in which couples and friends can find out how much they know about each other. Inventor and board games enthusiast Richard McLuckie, 48, with some of the games he has dreamed up . The idea for Who Put The Marmite In The Fridge came to Mr McLuckie when he realised that his French wife was putting the Marmite in the fridge, meaning it was unspreadable on his toast every morning. He said: \\'My wife always puts it in the fridge which makes it like concrete, and now my children do the same thing, and every morning I ask the same thing. \\'It occurred to me it would be a great name for a board game.\\' He and Mr Mackenzie-Walker developed their ideas for games in a series of dinners over the years, but only decided to launch their business in 2009 after the property market crashed and Mr McLuckie needed a new job. First they came up with Liar Liar, in which players try to persuade their opponents to believe made-up facts, and Eurobabble, a modern version of Chinese Whispers in which players translate from one language to another and another. In Who Put The Marmite In The Fridge, players have to avoid being left with the jar of Marmite. Mr McLuckie and his childhood friend Mr Mackenzie-Walker, right, spent many nights playing board games . Mr McLuckie and Mr Mackenzie-Walker, an accountant by trade who moved from Kent to southern Spain, have now had their games snapped up by shops including John Lewis, WH Smith, Waterstones and Amazon. They appeared on Dragons\\' Den last night, and said their preconceptions about the Dragons were shattered after meeting them. \\'We thought we\\'d really like Piers Linney and Kelly Hoppen but in fact we thought Piers was quite dull and Kelly was a little bit rude and dismissive,\\' Mr McLuckie said. \\'Deborah Meaden was a surprise, as we thought she would be hard-nosed when in fact she was absolutely delightful - so lovely. \\'We thought Peter Jones would be fun, which he was, and we thought Duncan Bannatyne would be a hard task-master, when in fact he was lovely - we are so pleased to be working with those two. \\'They\\'re both great to work with and a really good laugh, too.\\'',\n",
              " \"Richard McLuckie, 48, and Stuart Mackenzie-Walker, 51, invented games .\\nWon permission from Marmite owner Unilever to use its name and image .\\nThen they went on investment TV show to ask for funding from the Dragons .\\nBut Unilever contract said entrepreneurs couldn't mention name Marmite .\\nThree Dragons pulled out, but Peter Jones and Duncan Bannatyne agreed .\\nThey paid the men £50,000 for a 40 per cent stake in board game business .\")"
