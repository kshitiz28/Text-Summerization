The theme of the World Soil Day this year is 'Soils: where food begins.\n",

Soil is at the heart of all agricultural activities, food security, nutrition security and climate conservation.The World Soil Day is being observed today globally as well as in Nepal with the objective of raising public awareness on the significance of healthy soil and for the sustainable management of the soil fertility.Director General of the Department, Dr Rewati Raman Poudel said that the debate about food and nutritional security, sustainable agriculture development, conservation of bio-diversity and organic agriculture will have no meaning without the conservation, promotion and proper management of soil. Therefore, this problem of declining soil fertility has been taken as the common global problem.\n",
