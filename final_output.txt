 The World Soil Day programme reiterates the importance of soil for mankind and the crucial need for its conservation and proper management while at the same time increasing its fertility, the Department of Agriculture said
 Therefore, this problem of declining soil fertility has been taken as the common global problem
Poudel said the World Soil Day is being marked with the main goal of raising extensive public awareness to tackle this growing problem of loss in soil fertility
World Soil Day 2022 and its campaign "Soils: Where food begins" aims to raise awareness of the importance of maintaining healthy ecosystems and human well-being by addressing the growing challenges in soil management, increasing soil awareness and encouraging societies to improve soil health
The World Soil Day is being observed today globally as well as in Nepal with the objective of raising public awareness on the significance of healthy soil and for the sustainable management of the soil fertility
Soil degradation induces some soils to be nutrient depleted losing their capacity to support crops, while others have such a high nutrient concentration that represent a toxic environment to plants and animals, pollutes the environment and cause climate change
The soil fertility is deteriorating throughout the world including in Nepal in the recent years with the declining physical, chemical and biological features of the soil
Director General of the Department, Dr Rewati Raman Poudel said that the debate about food and nutritional security, sustainable agriculture development, conservation of bio-diversity and organic agriculture will have no meaning without the conservation, promotion and proper management of soil
